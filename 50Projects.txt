I. Day 1: Expanding Cards

1. How to center your content
- CSS
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; //Align items Vertically (top to bottom)
  align-items: center; //Align items in the middle (left to right: horizontaly since the direction is column)
  justify-content: center; //Align items in the middle (top to bottom: verticaly)
  height: 100vh; //Without the height , you will not see the effect of justify-content
}
-JS:
A node (querySelector) is different from an element(getElementBy)

II. Progress steps
- CSS:
transform: scale(0.98) a number lower than 1 will scale down & above will scale up
justify-content: space-between this will use the remaining space of the width and split it between element

-JS:
Grab all the element will work with (DOM)
If there's one element to grab => getElementBy..
If there's many elements to grab & use them as a group of node/Array => querySelectorAll
querySelector needs the type (".circle") but getElementById doesnt need ("circle")

III. Rotating Navigation

- CSS:
overflow-x: hidden; it only hides the scroll bar on the x-axis but we can still scroll thru Vertically
Transform-origin (the point around which the object rotates) is by default in the middle
-img {
  max-width: 100%; maximum of its container. This will prevent the pic to go beyond its container in small screen
}
